Pre-release version of Bitcoin from November 2008 sent to a few members of the Metzdowd cryptography mailing list.

This is an incomplete copy of the original codebase that Satoshi sent out to be reviewed by "the pros" that he thought could give him some feedback on the implementation.

It was shared by Ray Dillinger (aka Bear / Cryddit ) who was on the mailling list back in 2008. The thread on BitcoinTalk can be found here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=382374.0

One interesting note is that Satoshi gives credit in the readme.txt to Eric Young and OpenSSL - yet despite clearly using "CryptoPP" by Wei Dai, he does not reference him in the readme.txt
